  "description": "A Solana program intended to become the `stake_deposit_authority` of a StakePool deployed via the SPL stake-pool program. This program allows an admin to set a fee (in basis points) on the LST received from DepositStake that linearly decays to zero over a set number of seconds. This mechanism disincentivizes the immediate transfer of the LST after deposit.",
